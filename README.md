### Forecast

For generations, when people didn't know what to talk about, they talk about the weather. A hundred years ago, other than the Farmer's Almanac, there were no good ways to forecast the weather. These days, there are quite a few good sources (though almost all of them, including Yahoo & Apple, use Weather.com data which is partially sourced from their Wunderground subsidiary). Today, you'll use the DarkSky data to create your own weather app.

MINIMUM requirements for this entire assignment:
* Go to the [DarkSky API Website](https://developer.forecast.io/) and register for a key. (It's free up to 1000 calls per day & you get the key instantly)
* The app must have a way to search for a location by name and get the current weather (i.e. geocoding)
* There must be some visual indication (not just text/numbers) of the current data

HARD MODE #1 requirements for this assignment:
* Allow users to save their favorite locations so they don't have to look them up every time

HARD MODE #2 requirements for this assignment:
* Allow users to see a daily forecast
